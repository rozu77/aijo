                <h4>BEST TIME TO VISIT SIARGAO ISLAND</h4>
                <p>The best time to visit Siargao depends on what you are looking for. Many consider the best time of year when the weather is best but that also means crowds. I will give you a few options below about when is the best month to visit Siargao Island: </p>
                <p>September: Siargao hosts the ‘Cloud 9 Surfing Cup’ each September, an official WSL Pro event </p>
                <p>July – November: The best time period for surfing in Siargao is July until November. The easterly Mindanao current provides the islands with waves that came from the deepest regions of the Pacific. </p>
                <p>March – May: If you aren’t as interested in the surf but are craving that sun. March until May should bring you guaranteed sunny days. But it’s the Philippines so you can’t guarantee it. </p>
                <h4>WHERE IS SIARGAO ISLAND LOCATED</h4>
                <p>Siargao is located in the region of Mindanao in the Philippines. Mindanao is the southern region of the Philippines. </p>

                <h4>HOW TO GET TO SIARGAO ISLAND</h4>
                <p>Fly from Manila $60-$100</p>
                <p>Fry from Cebu $60-$100 </p>
                <p>Ferry from Surigao City to Siargao Island $5 </p>
                <p>There are ferries that leave from Manila and Cebu but they go to Surigao City first and then Siargao Island.</p>
                <h4>WHERE TO STAY IN SIARGAO ISLAND</h4>
                <p>Siargao is pretty straight forward when it comes to picking a region to stay. 90% of people choose to stay somewhere near General Luna. All of the bars, restaurants, tours, ports and hotels are near General Luna and Cloud 9 surf break. There are a couple of other regions you could stay in like Pacifico but unless you are purposely looking for isolation, General Luna is your spot. </p>
                <p>Aside from Airbnb, which obviously isn’t for everyone. There are two standouts, luxurious resorts for those with a bit bigger budget. </p>
